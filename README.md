# All That Matters: Rethinking Relevance for Primary School Children

## Abstract
The concept of \textit{relevance} in Information Retrieval (IR) has been extensively studied. However, mainstream IR models have primarily been developed with adult users in mind, assuming a degree of cognitive maturity and autonomous interaction. Younger searchers are extensively embedding IR systems into their information-seeking practices. Unlike adults, children bring different cognitive abilities, information needs, and limited digital knowledge that shape how they evaluate relevance, often diverging from traditional definitions. The growing use of IR systems by this underrepresented group calls for a deeper understanding of how they assess online content. In this work, we explore how children perceive and identify relevant information when searching for information online in the primary school classroom context. As children's information-seeking in this context is often guided by teachers, we also probe their perception and criteria for relevance. By identifying the values and perspectives of both students and educators, we uncover how relevance is shared, or not, among the different actors involved in the search process. These insights contribute to the design of more equitable and context-aware IR systems, supporting more responsible and articulated information-seeking behavior in primary school education.
